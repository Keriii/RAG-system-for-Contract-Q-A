## Contract Advisor RAG: A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP

Imagine a bot right from your Microsoft office Word window, advising you about your contract, rafting new contracts based on your preference, and enhancing existing oneâ€™s. What if I told you that this imagination has become a reality with Lizzy. Lizzy AI, an Israeli startup, is currently developing the next-generation contract AI which would serve as the first fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. They leverage Hybrid LLM technology (edge, private cloud and LLM services). The first stage of building this product is a powerful contract assistant, with the ultimate goal of developing a fully autonomous contract bot, capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts, independently, end-to-end, without human assistance.

## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to Build, Evaluate and Improve a simple RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract).

Key features

    RAG pipeline: The core of this project is to build a TAG pipeline that is able to efficiently respond to a given user query about the contract.

    RAG evaluation: This project is focuses on improving the RAG pipeline by experimenting with differnet parameters, RAG evaluation frameworks such as RAGAS help us which parameter is better than the other.

    Improvement: The idea is to build a high precision RAG pipeline by utilizing differnet parameters and improving the pipeline
